# testing "Manim GPT"'s capabilities

## motivation

wanted to see if i could use it to make my second project

## results

very bad spacial awareness

-   could not arrange circle sectors correctly (but then again thats pretty hard even for a human)
-   visual pythagorean proof was a disaster (but then again could be hard for a human)
-   sometimes places text ontop of previously generated text

likes to use boring text  
isnt great with colors

-   euler_identity good example, tried to highlight different parts but didnt really work, repeated colors
    usually generates something that wont break immediately
-   only time it broke was riemann.py but it just used an old function and it was a 5 min fix

pretty good at math/algorithms

-   kinda expected?
-   math in stuff is always correct
-   algorithm for fourier transform in fourier epicycles was good
